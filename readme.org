🥞 Testing wooden cutting boards to reduce plastic waste.
I read it cleans well if properly
treated with flax oil every two months.

✏️ I wanted to blog from org-mode to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]].  First I created [[https://github.com/kinnala/blog][kinnala/blog]]
repository. Then I installed [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss][ox-rss]]. Finally I wrote this entry in /readme.org/,
called =org-rss-export-to-rss= and committed the resulting files.
