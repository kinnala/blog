✏️ There was an issue of duplicate entries appearing.  I had to set
=:RSS_PERMALINK:= property to unique value for each post.

✏️ I wanted to blog from org-mode to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]].  First I created [[https://github.com/kinnala/blog][kinnala/blog]]
repository. Then I installed [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss][ox-rss]]. Finally I wrote this entry in /index.org/,
called =org-rss-export-to-rss= and committed the resulting files.
