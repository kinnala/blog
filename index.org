* ✏️ I noticed the org hyperlinks in the entries are only visible as plaintext urls (use Markdown instead).  Also there was some issue of duplicate entries appearing and I had to set :RSS_PERMALINK: property to unique value.

* ✏️ Connecting the resulting blog to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) requires just the url kinnala.github.io/blog/index.xml.  However, I noticed org-mode titles are interpreted as the actual entries.

* ✏️ I wanted to blog from org-mode to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).  First I created (kinnala/blog)[https://github.com/kinnala/blog] repository. Then I installed [ox-rss]([[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss)]]. Finally I wrote this entry in index.org, called org-rss-export-to-rss and committed the resulting files.
