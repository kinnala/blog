#+TITLE: Some things technical
#+AUTHOR: Tom Gustafsson
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* I wanted to blog with Emacs to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]].  First I created [[https://github.com/kinnala/blog][kinnala/blog]] repo with /index.org/ and enabled [[https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site][Pages]] from its settings. Then I installed [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss][ox-rss]] from Emacsmirror. Finally I wrote ✏️ this entry in /index.org/, ran /org-rss-export-to-rss/ and /org-html-export-to-html/, and committed the resulting files.

* Connecting the resulting blog to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]] requires just the url kinnala.github.io/blog/index.xml.  However, I noticed org-mode titles are interpreted as the actual entries ✏️.  This means the html export puts everything inside /<h1>/ tags.   Perhaps it requires tinkering at some point.
