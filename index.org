* Perhaps the issue of double posting is solved by not modifying the older entries ✏️.  I decided to put the newest entries on top.  I guess I don't really even need the html export and can just refer readers to [[https://micro.blog/kinnala]].

* I noticed the hyperlinks in the entries ✏️ are visible as plaintext urls.  Also there was some issue of duplicate entries appearing in Timeline after fixing a typo.

* Connecting the resulting blog to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]] requires just the url kinnala.github.io/blog/index.xml.  However, I noticed org-mode titles are interpreted as the actual entries ✏️.  This means the html export puts everything inside h1 tags.   Perhaps the html export requires tinkering at some point.

* I wanted to blog with Emacs to [[https://micro.blog/][micro.blog]].  First I created [[https://github.com/kinnala/blog][kinnala/blog]] with index.org and enabled Pages from its settings. Then I installed [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/ox-rss][ox-rss]]. Finally I wrote ✏️ this entry in index.org, ran org-rss-export-to-rss and org-html-export-to-html, and committed the resulting files.
